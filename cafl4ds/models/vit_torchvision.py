"""An ImageNet-pretrained ViT-B/16 backbone, exposed through the encoder ``embed`` surface.

Phase 0's forgetting calibration (P0.3.4) needs a *genuinely rich* phase-A representation so
that continued narrow training has something large to destroy. Training the hand-rolled
:class:`~cafl4ds.models.vit.TinyViTEncoder` from scratch never clears that bar — on
Split-CIFAR-100 the from-scratch supervised task-A probe tops out near 0.58 and the
forgetting contrast stays borderline (P0.3.4). A backbone pretrained on a large diverse
corpus does the "phase A" for us: a frozen ImageNet ViT-B/16 linear-probes ~0.94 on
CIFAR-100 task-A classes, leaving a deep well for the positive control to crater.

This wrapper adapts ``torchvision.models.vit_b_16`` to the two things the forgetting harness
asks of an encoder: an ``embed_dim`` attribute and a grad-enabled ``embed(imgs) -> [B, d]``
returning the pooled (class-token) representation. Inputs are the harness's native
``[0, 1]`` images at ``img_size``; this class resizes them to the 224 the ViT expects and
applies ImageNet normalization internally, so the rest of the harness stays resolution-
agnostic. Weights are loaded from a local ``state_dict_path`` (a checkpoint pre-fetched on the
host) so the run needs no network — the Gaudi container sees the file via a read-only bind
mount.
