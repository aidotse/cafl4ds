"""An MAE-pretrained ViT-B/16 backbone for the label-free forgetting fire (P0.3.6).

P0.3.4's fire is *supervised* (ImageNet-supervised weights + a supervised fine-tune); the
calibration cafl4ds actually needs is **instrument + MAE, label-free**. This encoder supplies
the deep phase-A well for that: the official MAE-pretrained ViT-B/16 (He et al. 2022) plugged in
as the backbone of the harness's MAE method, so continued **masked-reconstruction** training on a
new task can respecialize — and (the question P0.3.6 asks) *erode* — a genuinely rich SSL
representation, with no labels in the learning signal.

It subclasses :class:`~cafl4ds.models.vit.TinyViTEncoder` so the MAE method reads the exact
surface it expects (``forward_encoder(mask_ratio)``, ``num_patches``, ``patch_size``,
``embed_dim``, ``embed``). Built at ViT-B dims (224px / patch 16 / 768-d / depth 12 / 12 heads)
the official checkpoint loads **strict-clean** after a single key remap — its
``patch_embed.proj.*`` maps onto our bare-``Conv2d`` ``patch_embed.*`` (the only structural
difference; the timm-style block/qkv naming matches). The checkpoint is **encoder-only** (no
decoder / mask token), so the harness's :func:`~cafl4ds.ssl.factory.build_mae` supplies a fresh
decoder — warm it with a short phase A (``pretrained_encoder=true`` keeps these weights while
still training phase A) rather than ``skip_phase_a``.

Inputs are the harness's ``[0, 1]`` images at the source resolution; ``_embed_patches`` resizes
them to 224 and ImageNet-normalizes internally (matching the MAE pretraining distribution and the
host-validated ~0.80 CIFAR-100 task-A linear probe), so the rest of the harness stays
resolution-agnostic. Weights load offline from ``state_dict_path`` (a host-fetched checkpoint
bind-mounted into the Gaudi container).
