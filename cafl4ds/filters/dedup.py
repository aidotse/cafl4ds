"""SemDeDup-style near-duplicate removal — an admission knob (Abbas et al. 2023).

SemDeDup deduplicates a dataset by embedding it, clustering, and within each cluster dropping
points whose cosine similarity to a kept neighbour exceeds a threshold — keeping one
representative per near-duplicate group. Here we specialise the *within-cluster* step to a
single streaming batch: the batch is small, so no k-means is needed — we encode it with the
**current** model, then greedily keep points and drop any later point too similar (cosine) to
an already-kept one. This trims the redundancy a correlated stream pours in (many near-identical
consecutive frames), so the SSL update sees a more diverse diet.

This is a *label-free* selection heuristic over the live embedding (the fast edge); it never
touches labels or the SSL loss. Composes with the other admission knobs and, upstream of a
:class:`~cafl4ds.filters.reservoir.ReservoirReplay`, gives baseline **B1.5** (reservoir + dedup).
