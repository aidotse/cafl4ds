"""Loss-gate — keep the high-loss frames (SOFed 2022; loss-based importance).

A loss-based importance knob: score each incoming frame by the SSL loss the **current** model
incurs on it (:meth:`~cafl4ds.ssl.base.SSLMethod.per_sample_loss` — MAE's reconstruction error,
SimSiam's negative cosine) and keep only the fraction with the highest loss. High loss = the
model reconstructs / matches this frame poorly, i.e. it is the informative, not-yet-learned
part of the stream; low-loss frames are already-fit and cheap to skip. This is the "closest
prior art" loss-importance selection (baseline **B3**), run here as a streaming, label-free,
single-pass training-selection signal.

Like SemDeDup this is an *admission* knob (it narrows the batch) and consults only the live
model, never labels or a stored gradient.
