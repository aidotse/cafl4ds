"""The selection-filter interface (the ``A`` factor / independent variable).

The filter is the knob the whole study turns. The ``A`` factor has **two composable roles**,
because the cheap Phase-0 knobs are not all the same kind of thing:

* An **admission** :class:`Filter` *narrows* an incoming batch to a subset — B-floor
  (:class:`~cafl4ds.filters.accept_all.AcceptAll`, accept everything), SemDeDup
  (near-duplicate removal), the loss-gate (keep high-loss frames). Admission filters are pure
  batch reducers, so they **compose freely as a list** (apply one after another).
* A **replay** :class:`ReplayBuffer` decides what is *stored and replayed* — it may emit past
  items, so it can *grow* the training batch, and it carries state across steps. Reservoir
  sampling (:class:`~cafl4ds.filters.reservoir.ReservoirReplay`) is the Phase-0 instance. A
  buffer is a single-choice role and always runs **last** (after admission).

:class:`~cafl4ds.filters.composite.CompositeSelector` combines an admission list with an
optional buffer behind the single :class:`Filter` interface the loop calls, which is what lets
the plan's baselines be selected by config — B-floor, B1 (reservoir), dedup, loss-gate, and
B1.5 (dedup ∘ reservoir). Later phases add novelty (F-a), coverage (F-b), and the
health-steerable filter (F-c) behind these same interfaces.

The :class:`FilterContext` deliberately carries the live model and step so that
model-in-the-loop filters (the *fast edge*) and, later, health state (the *slow edge*) have
what they need without changing the loop's call site.
