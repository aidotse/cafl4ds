"""The composite selector — combine admission filters and a replay buffer (the ``A`` factor).

The cheap Phase-0 knobs split into two composable roles (see :mod:`cafl4ds.filters.base`):
zero or more **admission** :class:`~cafl4ds.filters.base.Filter` s that narrow the incoming
batch, and at most one **replay** :class:`~cafl4ds.filters.base.ReplayBuffer` that stores and
replays. :class:`CompositeSelector` wires them behind the single ``Filter.select`` interface
the loop calls, so *what* combination of knobs is active is purely a config choice:

======================  =========================  ====================
Baseline                admission                  buffer
======================  =========================  ====================
B-floor                 —                          —
B1  (reservoir)         —                          ReservoirReplay
dedup                   SemDeDup                    —
loss-gate  (B3)         LossGate                   —
B1.5  (dedup+replay)    SemDeDup                    ReservoirReplay
======================  =========================  ====================

Admission filters run in listed order (each narrows what the next sees); the buffer always
runs last, on the admitted frames. This ordering is structural: dedup/loss-gate decide what is
*worth admitting*, and the buffer then decides what of the admitted history to *replay* — the
reverse (replaying, then deduping the replay) would be meaningless.
