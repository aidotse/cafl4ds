"""The P1.0.2 deployment-prototype harness — multivariate, trust-annotated health logging.

Where the P1.0.0 harness (:mod:`cafl4ds.harness`) logs a *directional* smoke on toy data, the
deployment prototype logs the **full multivariate health vector** of one config-selected backbone on
the BDD regime diet, partitioned into two self-describing channels — a **label-free** vector (what a
real deployment would see) and a **labelled canary** (kNN / linear probes, ground truth available
because we control the eval set) — with every signal annotated by its Phase-0 calibrated status
(:mod:`cafl4ds.health_trust`) so the corpus is safe to mine without the code.

It reads **no degradation**. The acceptance bar is a **two-tier validation**: Tier A (the anyone-can-
run wiring check) asserts the pipeline is wired — every configured signal present at every checkpoint,
both channels populated, the trust map complete, nothing non-finite, memory flat; Tier B (our
sanity-of-readings pass) confirms the readings are plausible. This module owns the report the harness
writes; the arm execution reuses :mod:`cafl4ds.harness` untouched.

    Not a degradation read, and not the Tier-A wiring gate: it confirms the logged trajectory is
    *plausible* the way P1.0.2's acceptance bar describes — RankMe stays in a sane range, drift
    accumulates off zero, and the labelled canary sits above chance. Deliberately loose (floors on
    *aggregates*, never a per-checkpoint gate): the canary is the thin channel — its mean clears
    chance by only a few points and *individual* checkpoints dip below chance — so a per-step canary
    gate would flap ``passed=false`` on a perfectly healthy drive (RankMe stays comfortably in range
    and the projector drift accumulates fine; the canary is the one that needs the aggregate floor —
    audit P1.0 B1 / C2). Downstream studies can tighten the thresholds as their diets bite harder.
