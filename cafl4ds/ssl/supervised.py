"""Supervised classifier wrapper — a training-signal vehicle for forgetting calibration.

Not an SSL method in spirit, but it satisfies the :class:`~cafl4ds.ssl.base.SSLMethod`
interface (``encode`` / ``embedding_surfaces``) so the forgetting harness reads it through the
*same* frozen-backbone probe and drift instruments as MAE. Its role is to supply the
**guaranteed respecialisation pressure** the self-supervised MAE objective does not: SSL
reconstruction learns broadly transferable features and barely forgets (P0.3.0–P0.3.3), so a
supervised cross-entropy signal is used instead to *induce* a clean catastrophic-forgetting
event on which to calibrate BWT/FM. A linear classification head is trained per task on top of
the backbone (the head is created and owned by the harness, not this class, since its width
changes per task); training task B overwrites the task-A representation and the transfer probe
on A craters. Only the backbone persists across tasks — exactly the representation the
instruments read.
