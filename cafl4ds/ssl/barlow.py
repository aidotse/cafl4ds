"""Barlow Twins SSL method — the redundancy-collapse ``C`` vehicle (Zbontar et al. 2021).

Barlow Twins is a joint-embedding method with no predictor, no stop-gradient, and no
negatives: it pulls two augmented views together by driving their **cross-correlation matrix**
toward the identity. The objective has two terms on that matrix ``C`` (computed on
batch-normalized projector outputs):

* the **invariance** term ``(C_ii - 1)^2`` — make each feature agree across the two views;
* the **redundancy-reduction** term ``lambda * C_ij^2`` (``i != j``) — decorrelate distinct
  features so they carry non-redundant information.

That second term is Barlow's *anti-collapse* mechanism, and it is the analogue of SimSiam's
predictor + stop-gradient. Toggling it off (``anti_collapse=False``) is the one-toggle ablation
that makes this the Phase-0 **redundancy-collapse** positive control (P0.2.3): the projector's
terminal ``BatchNorm(affine=False)`` still pins every feature to unit variance (so per-dimension
variance *cannot* vanish — this is not point collapse), but with no decorrelation pressure the
features are free to become copies of one another. The trivial optimum is therefore a
**redundancy / dimensional** collapse: the off-diagonal covariance climbs and the effective rank
falls, while `mean_feature_var` stays healthy — the sub-mode `offdiag_cov` is built to catch and
that SimSiam's point-collapse vehicle (P0.2/P0.2.1/P0.2.2) never produces. As with SimSiam, the
health monitor reads the *encoder* embedding and the projector surface, never a training head.

    Barlow Twins avoids collapse with a single mechanism — the **redundancy-reduction**

    toggles it: with it ``True`` (default) the method runs as published (invariance +
    ``lambd`` * redundancy-reduction); with it ``False`` the redundancy-reduction term is
    dropped, giving the documented **redundancy-collapse** positive control (P0.2.3). Because
    the projector's terminal ``BatchNorm(affine=False)`` holds every feature at unit variance,
    the ablated optimum is *not* point collapse (per-dimension variance is preserved) but
    dimensional collapse — the features become mutually redundant, so off-diagonal covariance
    climbs while `mean_feature_var` stays quiet.
