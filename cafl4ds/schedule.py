"""Learning-rate schedules for the training loops.

Phase-0 P0.1/P0.2 ran a **flat** learning rate over a single ~25-step pass. P0.2.1 found that
a genuine healthy SimSiam baseline (a RankMe that recovers and holds, rather than decaying
indistinguishably from a forced collapse) needs a *fair* training regime: multiple epochs with
a **warmup + cosine-decay** schedule. As the LR anneals, the intact model's effective rank
re-expands from the early-training dip — the healthy U-shape that separates it from the
collapsed arm. This module supplies that schedule as a plain, Hydra-instantiable factory.

        warmup_frac: Fraction of ``total_steps`` spent warming up, in ``[0, 1)``.
