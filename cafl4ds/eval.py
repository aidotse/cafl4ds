"""Downstream evaluation — probe-on-past, forgetting, and the B5 adaptation floor.

The *validating* axis of the study (the payoff, `[STD]`), kept separate from the *diagnostic*
health signals in :mod:`cafl4ds.monitor`. Three pieces, all label-in-the-probe-only:

* **Probe-on-past** — the current encoder, evaluated on every past era's held-out set, builds
  an accuracy matrix ``R[i][j]`` = accuracy on era ``j`` after training through era ``i``
  (:class:`PerEraProbe`, one row recorded per era as the correlated stream advances).
* **Forgetting metrics** — from that matrix, :func:`backward_transfer` (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato
  2017) and :func:`forgetting_measure` (Chaudhry et al. 2018): how much learning later eras
  eroded accuracy on earlier ones. The direct readout of *degradation present* (question **b**).
* **Adaptation vs. B5** — :func:`adaptation_report` compares the adapted encoder's downstream
  probe accuracy against the init-matched **frozen** backbone (baseline B5,
  :func:`cafl4ds.measurements.frozen_baseline`): does adapting beat doing nothing (question
  **a**)?

Forgetting is a *correlated-stream* phenomenon: with a single era (IID) there is no past to
forget, so the matrix has one row and the forgetting metrics are ``None`` (undefined).
