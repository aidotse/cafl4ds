"""Per-metric fire/quiet analysis for the collapse-instrument calibration (P0.2.2).

P0.2.1 calibrated a single instrument (RankMe) with a bespoke gate. P0.2.2 maps the *whole*
collapse suite — RankMe, VICReg variance/covariance, Wang & Isola uniformity/alignment — read
at every embedding surface the method exposes (``backbone`` and ``proj``). This module turns
the two arms' health series (``PC`` = forced collapse, ``healthy`` = intact SimSiam) into a
per-``(instrument × surface)`` **separation** and a two-sided **fires / quiet** reading, so we
can see *where each instrument responds and where it does not* across regimes.

It is a **reporting layer**, not a hard gate: the certified RankMe gate stays in
``scripts/positive_control.py``. Thresholds here are provisional mapping aids (the point of
P0.2.2 is to *find* each instrument's envelope), so the raw finals are always reported
alongside the booleans.

Each instrument carries its collapse **direction** and **scale**:

* ``rankme`` — ``down`` (collapse lowers effective rank), ratio ``healthy/PC``. The reference.
* ``mean_feature_var`` — ``down`` (dimensions → constant), ratio ``healthy/PC``.
* ``offdiag_cov`` — ``up`` (redundancy raises off-diagonal mass), ratio ``PC/healthy``. NB:
  point-collapse (SimSiam's mode) drives *all* variance → 0, so covariance → 0 too — this
  instrument targets a *different* (redundancy) sub-mode and is expected to stay quiet here.
* ``uniformity`` — ``up`` (embeddings clump, the potential climbs toward 0), gap ``PC−healthy``
  (values are negative, so a ratio is ill-defined).
* ``alignment`` — **not standalone**: under point-collapse positives map to the same constant,
  so alignment → 0 ("perfectly aligned"), which looks *healthy* in isolation. Reported for
  interpretation, read jointly with uniformity, never gated alone.
