"""Run logging — one run log, two separate series (SSL loss and health).

The Phase-0 exit criterion is a single run log in which the **SSL loss** and the **health
metrics** (rankme, drift, probe) can be read *side by side over steps*. This module writes
one JSONL file per run, each line a record tagged with its ``series`` (``"loss"`` or
``"health"``), and mirrors a human-readable line to loguru. Every health record also carries
the most recent loss, so :func:`tabulate` can render the required side-by-side table from the
health series alone.
