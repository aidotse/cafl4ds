"""The streaming SSL adaptation loop (Phase 0).

Ties the pieces together: pull batches from the :class:`~cafl4ds.data.streams.EraStream`, pass
each through the :class:`~cafl4ds.filters.base.Filter` (Phase 0: the B-floor accept-all knob),
run one self-supervised update on the accepted images, log the loss every step, and every
``eval_every`` steps read the :class:`~cafl4ds.monitor.HealthMonitor` and log the health
series. Loss and health land in the *same* run log as *separate* series so they can be read
side by side over steps (the Phase-0 exit criterion).

By default this is a single-pass streaming loop: no replay, no shuffling of the incoming
order — the model sees the correlated stream exactly as it arrives. It also supports a
**multi-epoch** regime (``epochs > 1``, the stream re-iterated in the same order) with an
optional per-step **LR scheduler** — the fair training regime the P0.2.1 healthy-baseline
calibration needs (the correlated single pass is still the default, and the Phase-1 setting).
