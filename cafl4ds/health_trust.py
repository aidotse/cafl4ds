"""Phase-0 calibration trust map for the deployment-prototype harness (P1.0.2).

Distils the Phase-0 Failure-Modes scoreboard (``docs/experiments/phase0/index.md``) into a typed,
provenance-pinned registry: for each ``(backbone family, health signal)``, what Phase 0 established
about *reading* it — ``calibrated`` / ``candidate`` / ``trap`` / ``needs-two-sided-control`` /
``needs-labels`` — and for which failure mode. The deployment harness stamps this into every logged
artifact, so the multivariate health traces are **self-describing**: a consumer never fuses a signal
that is a known *trap* in the mode it cares about (e.g. ``uniformity_proj``, calibrated to collapse,
*mis-signals* on forgetting — P0.6.0).

This is **fixed reference truth**, not a runtime knob — hence code, enum-typed, and unit-tested for
completeness against the signal menu. Each entry cites the Phase-0 substudy that earned it, which
binds the registry to ``phase0/index.md`` under the accuracy mandate: if a Phase-0 verdict changes,
both move together.

The registry annotates the **label-free** geometry/drift signals plus the **labelled canary** probes
(``knn_acc`` / ``linear_acc``). ``grad_norm`` (the instability reader) lives in the loss series, not
the monitor's health dict, so it is annotated for reference but excluded from the health-menu
completeness contract.
