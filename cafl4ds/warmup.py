"""Warm a "generally competent" well for the P1.0.2 deployment drive.

Phase 0 read health *after* the representation had settled — a competent well, warmed until the loss
plateaus (P0.3.10's reconstruction-competence plateau) — because reading a still-settling from-scratch
model confounds "the model waking up" with "a response to the stream" (P0.3.9's fresh-head transient).
This module reproduces that discipline for the deployment prototype: it trains a backbone on a
**stationary** all-regime sample (the drive's nonstationarity is deliberately withheld) until the SSL
loss stops improving, then saves the **whole method** — encoder *and* head — as a reusable well.

Saving the whole method is the load-bearing detail. The Phase-0 checkpoint utilities are encoder-only;
resuming a warm encoder onto a *fresh* head would replay the very transient P0.3.9 spent a substudy
removing. A drive that loads this well resumes the model intact, so the trajectory starts from genuine
competence with no head warm-up to misread. The well is produced once per backbone and reused across
drives (identical start state → drive-to-drive comparisons carry no per-run warmup variance).

Compute-agnostic: a single ``device`` string, no hardware branching. The stationary diet comes from
:meth:`cafl4ds.data.regime.RegimeStream.stationary_batches` (the reserved training pool, reshuffled
regime-agnostic), so the well is competent on the same probe set the drive reads.
