"""The P1.0.2 hand-off corpus — turn logged health arms into a wide, metadata-tagged time series.

Where :mod:`cafl4ds.deploy` assembles the run-time deploy *report* (the trust-annotated channels + the
Tier-A verdict), this module turns that report into the **corpus a partner actually mines**: a flat,
wide table with one row per ``(seed, arm, checkpoint)``, every health signal a column, and each row
tagged with the **event-relative coordinates** that make a stateful trajectory comparable across seeds
— the leg (``era_index`` / ``era_name``) it was read in, whether it sits on a regime **transition**,
and how many steps into the leg it is. Alongside the table it writes the **leg map** (``segments.json``
— the ordered regime blocks, derived from the same era sequence), the **trust map**, and a provenance
**manifest**.

The transforms are pure (no torch, no harness) and fully testable; the writer emits ``health.csv`` via
the stdlib and ``health.parquet`` via a **lazy** ``pyarrow`` import, so the wheel never hard-requires
it. The corpus is the deliverable; the health series it reads come from :mod:`cafl4ds.harness` arms,
projected through :func:`cafl4ds.deploy.build_deploy_report`.
