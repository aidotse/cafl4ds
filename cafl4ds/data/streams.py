"""Streaming datasets: order a :class:`~cafl4ds.data.sources.DataSource` into eras.

The stream is the ``F`` (data-order) factor of the experiment. Phase 0 uses a single
:class:`EraStream` with two orderings:

* ``order="class_blocked"`` — the **synthetic correlation** of Phase 1a: all of class 0, then
  all of class 1, …. Each class block is an **era**. This is the correlated stream whose
  degradation the instruments must catch.
* ``order="iid"`` — a shuffled single pass (one era). This is the *well-behaved reference*
  used to produce the ``I=pretrained`` warm-start checkpoint — correlation must **not** leak
  into the clean starting point.

Labels are used only to (a) build the class-blocked ordering and (b) construct held-out eval
sets; they never appear in a :class:`StreamBatch`, so they can never enter the SSL update.
Each stream reserves, per class, a disjoint held-out **probe support**, **probe query**, and
**per-era** eval set before ordering the remaining images into the training stream.
