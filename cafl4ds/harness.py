"""The Phase-1 multi-arm harness — live / PC / B5 co-logged into one canonical artifact.

Phase 0 left the loop's pieces scattered: the adapting backbone ran in one place
(:mod:`cafl4ds.loop`), a separate positive-control *script* manufactured each failure mode,
and the frozen-backbone floor (B5) was measured only at run-end. Phase 1 reads every live
health trajectory *against its gate* (the load-bearing Phase-0 lesson — a signal is only
interpretable against its gate), so the three arms have to be one loop, co-logged on a shared
step index, under one schema.

This module is that orchestration, kept Hydra-free (the wiring lives in
``scripts/run_harness.py``) so the arms, the alignment, the gate, and the canonical
``comparison.json`` schema are all unit-testable:

* **live** — the adapting backbone under the base filter (a :class:`~cafl4ds.loop.StreamingLoop`
  run, reused untouched).
* **PC** — a *manufactured* pathology whose instruments must fire (the gate). The shipped smoke
  PC is Phase-0's cheapest single-pass calibrated fire: SimSiam with anti-collapse **off**
  (``anti_collapse=False``), whose SSL loss rides to its ``-1`` constant-solution floor and whose
  projector RankMe craters. Per-mode PC scripts (forgetting, …) plug into the same arm slot.
* **B5** — the frozen, init-matched backbone floor: measured only, never stepped, stamped onto
  the live arm's step grid so all three arms share one index.

The harness is deliberately **number-free** (P1.0.0): it proves the rig *runs*, the instruments
move in the right *direction*, the PC fires, and nothing goes non-finite. Reading movement *as
degradation* is the mode studies' job (P1.3 / P1.4).
