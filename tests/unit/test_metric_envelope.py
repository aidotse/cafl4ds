"""Tests for the P0.2.2 collapse-suite envelope reporting layer.

Confirms that :func:`metric_envelope` orients each instrument's separation in its own collapse
direction (ratio vs. gap), fires only for standalone detectors that separate the right way,
detects the projector (``_proj``) surface as its own row, and never fires on the non-standalone
alignment metric — and that the table renderer handles all of that without crashing.

# Finals chosen so every standalone instrument separates in its collapse direction on `backbone`
# but rankme's `proj` surface stays quiet (a non-firing case), and alignment "looks aligned"
# under collapse (small gap) yet must never fire because it is not a standalone detector.
