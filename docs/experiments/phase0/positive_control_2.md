# Positive control 2 — the healthy SimSiam baseline (P0.2.1)

The third Phase-0 sub-study (P0.2.1; see the [Phase 0 overview](index.md)). It **continues the collapse-instrument
calibration** begun in [P0.2](positive_control_1.md): same vehicle (predictorless / stop-gradient-off SimSiam as the
forced-collapse arm), same goal (prove the instruments catch a real collapse), but it fixes the flaw P0.2 exposed — the
intact "healthy" arm was **not actually a healthy baseline**, so the gate had no trustworthy upper reference. It then
asks how far that baseline reaches: a [2×2 regime matrix](#does-the-baseline-generalize-the-22-regime-matrix) — {IID,
class-blocked} × {40 epochs, single pass} (+ ablations on LR and horizon length) — testing whether the calibration
survives toward the project's target regime (correlated ordering, single-pass streaming). It does not: only the clean,
long-horizon corner certifies.

## Why this exists (what P0.2 left open)

P0.2 ran both arms **from-scratch, single-pass (~25 steps), on the class-blocked stream** — the P0.1 toy horizon. At
that horizon the intact arm's RankMe decayed to ~30–40% of its init, **indistinguishable from the forced collapse**;
only the loss floor separated the two. That left the central question unanswerable: was the intact arm's RankMe decay
(a) SimSiam's genuine single-pass dynamics — in which case the baseline is fundamentally compromised — or (b) a
small-experiment artifact that disappears with a fair training budget? P0.2.1 answers it: **(b)**. With a fair training
regime the intact model's RankMe **re-expands and holds**, cleanly above the collapse floor, and the gate can finally
separate the arms on RankMe itself.

## The finding: a fair training regime, *not* a bigger model

The load-bearing change is the **training regime**, not capacity. The backbone — the representation actually under study
— is the **same tiny ViT** as P0.1/P0.2 (`embed_dim=96`, `depth=4`, `img_size=32`). What changed, and why each matters
(established by the exploration sweep, `scratchpad`-only):

| Change (vs P0.2) | Why it is load-bearing |
| -- | -- |
| **IID (shuffled) ordering** | Isolates the anti-collapse ablation as the *only* cause of collapse. On the class-blocked correlated stream the same regime does **not** separate the arms (intact ~2.7–3.5 vs collapse ~2.0) — see the [2×2 regime matrix](#does-the-baseline-generalize-the-22-regime-matrix) below; that is a Phase-1 phenomenon, not a calibration baseline. |
| **Full STL-10 train split** (~400 train/class, was capped at 120→80) | The dominant lever. With P0.2's small data the intact arm's RankMe stalls at ~3.5; with the full split it re-expands to ~5.5. |
| **40 epochs** (was a single ~25-step pass) | SimSiam needs a real horizon to reach its stable non-collapsed regime; the recovery happens in the later epochs. (60 epochs adds nothing: ~5.8 → plateaued.) |
| **Warmup + cosine LR** (was flat) | The healthy RankMe re-expands *as the LR anneals* — the U-shape. A flat LR does not produce the clean recovery. |
| **Predictor `pred_hidden` 64 → 128** | SimSiam's predictor *is* its anti-collapse mechanism; the repo default (64 = `proj_dim`/2) is too narrow at this scale and left the intact arm marginal (~4.0, gate-borderline). Widening only the predictor lifts it to ~5.5. The projector (`proj_hidden=256`) is unchanged. |

Not load-bearing (checked, held fixed for other reasons): **batch size** — 32 vs 128 give the same RankMe separation, so
128 is kept only because it is ~2× faster in wall-clock; and **model capacity / image resolution** — never scaled.

## The healthy U-shape (the signature)

At random init the embeddings are diffuse and high-rank (RankMe ~10.8 — an *inflated* value, not a healthy reference).
Early training organizes the representation and RankMe **dips** (to ~3.5 by epoch ~6). Then, as the LR anneals over the
remaining epochs, the intact model's effective rank **re-expands and holds** at ~5.5 — the healthy U-shape. The
forced-collapse arm, by contrast, sinks monotonically to the ~1.9 projector-BatchNorm floor and stays pinned. **That
U-shape vs. monotone-to-floor is the separation the gate reads.**

## The gate, redesigned (two changes from P0.2, both driven by the runs)

P0.2's gate is recalibrated in `cafl4ds/configs/positive_control.yaml` and evaluated in `scripts/positive_control.py`
(prints `PASS`/`FAIL`, writes `comparison.json`, exits non-zero on failure). It passes iff **all** hold:

1. **PC collapses on RankMe (relative).** PC final RankMe ≤ **35%** of its own random-init RankMe (measured ~18%).
    Relative, because the projector `BatchNorm(affine=False)` keeps deep collapse off literal rank-1 (floor ~1.9), so
    an absolute low floor is unreachable at this scale.
1. **PC "right reason" (point-collapse fingerprint).** PC loss floor (min over steps) ≤ **−0.9** — it rides to its −1
    constant-solution floor (measured ~−1.00). If rank fell but the loss did not approach −1, the wiring would be
    suspect.
1. **The healthy control holds (absolute).** Intact final RankMe ≥ **4.0** (measured ~5.4–5.7; floor ~1.9).
1. **RankMe separation.** `healthy_final / PC_final` ≥ **2.0×** (measured ~2.7–2.8×). This is the discriminator P0.2
    lacked.

**Two deliberate departures from P0.2:**

- **The discriminator flipped from loss to RankMe.** In this fair-training regime **both** arms reach a low SSL loss
    (~−0.9 — a low cosine loss is entirely compatible with a healthy SimSiam), so the loss-floor gap is ~0.03 and no
    longer separates the arms. RankMe now does. (P0.2's toy horizon was the opposite: loss separated, RankMe did not.)
    Loss is kept **only** as the PC's "right reason" fingerprint.
- **Dropped the "healthy ≥ 60% of its own random-init RankMe" criterion.** Random init is diffuse/inflated (RankMe
    ~10.8); a healthy SSL model legitimately sheds that before re-expanding to ~5.5 (≈53% of init), so "hold near init"
    is the wrong reference. The healthy arm is gated on an **absolute floor well above the collapse floor** instead.

## The calibration corner — IID × 40 epochs (CPU)

This is the corner the calibration is *derived* in, and the reference the
[2×2 matrix](#does-the-baseline-generalize-the-22-regime-matrix) below is measured against. One session per seed, both
arms, **IID** STL-10, full train split, `batch_size=128`, 40 epochs, warmup+cosine LR, tiny ViT (same backbone as P0.1).
`pc_*` = collapse ablation, `hc_*` = intact SimSiam. Both seeds **PASS** (later corroborated at **4 seeds** by the
[horizon sweep](#how-cheap-can-the-reference-be-a-horizon-sweep-is-40-the-minimum-and-is-it-a-plateau), worst-of-four
2.47×).

## Device portability (Gaudi 2 HPU)

Per the P0.1/P0.2 milestone convention, the identical run (`device=hpu`, inside the container) reproduces on a Gaudi 2
HPU: the loop is device-portable, every logged value is finite, and the gate verdict is unchanged. The healthy arm
re-expands to RankMe **5.18** (CPU 5.69) and the PC sinks to the ~1.9 floor while its loss rides to −1.0 — the same
qualitative contrast; the modest endpoint delta is the expected CPU-vs-HPU floating-point divergence over 1280 steps
(from-scratch init is bit-identical, built on CPU before the move to `hpu`).

```
      (HPU, seed 0)   PC RankMe 10.88 -> 1.89 (17.4%)   healthy RankMe -> 5.18   ratio 2.74x   PC loss floor -1.00   verdict PASS
```

## Does the baseline generalize? The 2×2 regime matrix

The calibration above is derived in one specific corner — **IID ordering, 40 epochs** — chosen to isolate the
anti-collapse ablation as the only cause of collapse. But the regime the rest of the project runs in differs on **two**
axes:

- **Ordering.** Phase 1+ streams are temporally *correlated* (class-blocked and worse), not shuffled IID.
- **Horizon.** The target loop is *single-pass* streaming — each sample seen roughly once — not a 40-epoch offline
    budget.

That raises a question with a potential **immediate win**: does the healthy baseline (and the gate built on it)
*survive* toward the target regime? If a single-pass and/or correlated baseline certified just as cleanly, we would not
need to carry a separate 40-epoch IID calibration run — we could calibrate in the regime we actually deploy in. So we
ran the full 2×2 — {IID, class-blocked} × {40 epochs, single pass} — holding *everything else* in the P0.2.1 fair regime
fixed (same tiny ViT, full STL-10 train split, warmup+cosine LR, `pred_hidden=128`), and asked which corners the gate
passes.

**Only the IID × 40-epoch corner passes.** (`healthy` = intact SimSiam final RankMe; `PC` = collapse-ablation final
RankMe; `ratio` = healthy / PC; the gate needs healthy ≥ 4.0 **and** ratio ≥ 2.0×. Ranges span seeds 0/1.)

```

The three failing corners fail for **two distinct reasons**, one per axis — and reading them apart is the whole point.

**Horizon axis (→ single pass): the *collapse control* never finishes collapsing.** Over a single pass (32 IID / 40
class-blocked steps) the PC only descends to ~3.0–3.8 RankMe — 28–36% of its init, still visibly mid-collapse, nowhere
near the ~1.9 projector-BatchNorm floor it reaches given the full horizon. The *healthy* arm, by contrast, **clears the
4.0 floor in every single-pass run** (4.2–4.9). So the gate fails not because the baseline is unhealthy but because the
collapse *reference* is under-developed: both arms sit in the ~3–5 band and never separate by 2×. (In the IID
single-pass seed-0 run the PC even misses the "≤ 35% of init" relative-collapse check, at 36% — it simply has not had
the steps.)

**Ordering axis (→ correlated, at the long horizon): the *healthy* arm is suppressed.** At 40 epochs the PC fully
collapses (~2.0) but the class-blocked ordering drags the intact arm down to ~2.7–3.5, toward the collapse floor, so
again there is no 2× gap — the *mirror image* of the single-pass failure (the contrast closes from above, not from
below). Holding budget, schedule, model and data *volume* fixed, merely presenting classes one-block-at-a-time
suppresses the intact model's effective rank by ~40%; even 40 repeated passes do not undo it. This is exactly the
Phase-1 degradation phenomenon the project is about, in miniature.

**And the axes do not simply add: at the single-pass horizon, ordering barely matters.** IID and class-blocked
single-pass are nearly identical (healthy ~4.2–4.9 either way; PC ~3.0–3.8 either way) — the ~40% correlation penalty
that halves the healthy RankMe at 40 epochs does *not* bite in one pass. Seeing each class-block once is, for these
transient dynamics, close to seeing the shuffled stream once; correlation needs *repeated* multi-epoch exposure to
express its suppression.

Trajectories make the two mechanisms visible:

**Class-blocked × 40 epochs** — the healthy arm dips as under IID but its recovery is **suppressed**, plateauing at ~3.5
instead of re-expanding to ~5.7:

```

(Health is read once per epoch; since one epoch = one full class cycle, every reading lands at the same phase — just
after class 9 — so the `era` column shows 0 except at the final step. The suppression is a property of the trained
representation, not of the sampling phase.)

**IID × single pass** (seed 0) — neither arm reaches its asymptote in 32 steps: the PC is still descending (~3.8, not
~2.0) and the healthy arm settles at ~4.9 without the late re-expansion the 40-epoch horizon produces:

```

(Class-blocked × single pass is nearly identical in shape — healthy ~4.6, PC ~3.5.)

## Ablation: Was the default LR the culprit? An LR sweep on the single-pass IID cell

The single-pass runs above use the default AdamW LR (`1e-3`), chosen for no principled reason. Before concluding the
single-pass contrast is unrecoverable, we must rule out the obvious lever: **is there a single LR at which — over the
same single pass — the PC floors while the healthy arm stays up?** "Floors" means the genuine point-collapse fingerprint
(RankMe → the ~1.9 BatchNorm floor *and* loss → −1), so we are not fooled by rank merely wandering; "stays up" means the
healthy arm holds the ≥ 4.0 gate floor. If such an LR exists, the single-pass contrast is recoverable and LR was the
missing lever. So we swept the optimizer's base LR across three orders of magnitude, both arms, both seeds, everything
else fixed at the single-pass IID cell (probes off — only RankMe and the loss floor are read; the `1e-3` point
reproduces the cell's documented 4.92 / 3.85 exactly, since the probe flags change only what is *measured*, not the
trajectory).

(`*` = default LR, reproduces the single-pass IID cell. Seed 1 is nearly identical: healthy holds ≥ 4.0 only for LR ≤
1e-3 [4.20 at 1e-3], the PC floors only for LR ≥ 3e-3 [1.57, loss −0.99] where the healthy arm has already sunk to 1.97
— the same disjoint boundary. Max ratio across the whole grid, either seed, is ~1.4×.)

**The two regions are disjoint — no such LR exists.** "Healthy up" holds only at LR ≤ 1e-3; "PC floored" only at LR ≥
3e-3; they never overlap. At the crossover (`2e-3`) *neither* condition holds — the healthy arm has already fallen below
4.0 (3.33) while the PC has not yet reached its floor (2.61). And the separation ratio never clears ~1.4× anywhere on
the grid, nowhere near the 2× bar.

**Why they can't be separated: at single-pass horizon, LR is a *second* collapse cause coupled to the first.** A high LR
does not just accelerate training — it is itself a collapse driver, so cranking it up is no longer a clean anti-collapse
ablation. The one knob (LR) sets how far *both* arms travel within the fixed 32-step budget. Turn it down and neither
arm reaches its endpoint — the PC has not collapsed (it is still ~3.8–10, loss > −0.9). Turn it up enough to drive the
PC to its floor within 32 steps and the *same* aggressive updates crush the healthy arm to the same floor — but that
healthy collapse is now **LR-driven, not a verdict on the representation**, so it cannot be read as "healthy failed."
Flooring the PC by raising LR therefore does not rescue the contrast; it only adds a confound. The anti-collapse
machinery (predictor + stop-gradient) needs *horizon* — steps over which to build the non-collapsed structure and let
RankMe re-expand as the LR anneals (the 40-epoch U-shape) — not merely a better LR. A single pass denies it those steps
at every LR. Note too that the best single-pass contrast on the entire grid (~1.3×) sits at the default `1e-3`, so the
matrix's single-pass FAIL was **not** an artifact of a poorly-chosen LR — the default was already near-optimal for the
(insufficient) single-pass separation.

**Was it the *schedule*, not the LR? A flat-LR control.** One objection remains: the sweep above ran the default
warmup+cosine schedule, which over a 32-step pass spends ~3 steps warming up and the remaining ~29 **annealing the LR to
zero**. So a nominally high LR is only briefly at peak and is near-frozen exactly at the endpoint where we read RankMe —
maybe the anneal *starves the PC's collapse*, and the "no band" verdict is a schedule artifact. We tested this directly:
re-ran the single-pass IID sweep with a **flat LR** (`schedule.warmup_frac=0.0 schedule.min_lr_frac=1.0` holds the
multiplier at 1.0 for all 32 steps), both arms, seed 0.

```

```

The objection is *mechanically* right about the PC, yet the verdict is unchanged — indeed reinforced. Without the anneal
the PC floors at **~3× lower LR** (flat `1e-3` vs annealed `3e-3`): the cosine decay *was* holding the PC back. But that
same anneal is the *only* thing that lifts the **healthy** arm's RankMe back up (the U-shape is anneal-driven — see
`cafl4ds/schedule.py`); remove it and at flat `1e-3` the healthy arm is already at 3.13, below the 4.0 floor. Both
thresholds slide down in lockstep — the anneal is the *best* case for separation, and it still is not enough.

**A dense sweep of the flip zone (3e-4 → 1e-3, both seeds, flat LR)** confirms there is no band hiding between the
coarse points, and shows *why* — the crossover is not a plateau where a healthy arm sits above a floored PC, it is the
point where **both arms free-fall through the same RankMe values together**, the healthy one a step behind:

```

The single LR where both binary gate flags co-trip (seed 1, `5e-4`) is neither **robust** — on seed 0 the same LR leaves
the PC uncollapsed, with an empty gap at `7e-4` where *neither* holds — nor **meaningful**: healthy `4.34` vs PC `3.41`
is only **1.27×**, and "PC floored" fires there only on the *relative* 35%-of-init rule, with the PC still at `3.41`,
nowhere near its ~1.9 floor. The decisive number: **the best RankMe ratio anywhere on the entire fine grid is ~1.3×**,
against a 2.0× gate. The disjointness is therefore a property of the single-pass horizon, not of the schedule or the LR
granularity.

## Ablation: How cheap can the reference be? A horizon sweep (is 40 the *minimum*, and is it a plateau?)

Single-pass is dead as a shortcut, but the horizon axis is continuous — so where between one pass and 40 epochs does the
≥2× contrast first become **trustworthy**, and is 40 itself a stable plateau rather than a lucky point? We swept the
horizon on the canonical config (IID, default `1e-3`, warmup+cosine, `pred_hidden=128`; probes off; each horizon gets
its own fully-annealed schedule since `total_steps = epochs × batches`), reading the gate ratio `healthy / PC`. The
robustness bar is the **minimum ratio across seeds**, not the mean — a reference you re-run casually must pass on a bad
draw, not just on average. The crossover region (25/30) and 40 were run at **4 seeds**; the rest at 2.

```

(40-epoch seeds 0/1 are the [canonical corner](#the-calibration-corner--iid--40-epochs-cpu) numbers; seeds 2/3 were
added here to level it to 4 seeds against the crossover.)

Three results:

1. **40 is not a local optimum.** The mean ratio climbs monotonically and keeps climbing past 40, out to 80 (2× the
    horizon): 0.96 → 1.33 → 1.77 → 2.20 → 2.31 → **2.87** → 2.92 → 2.89 → 3.27. No peak-then-decline; the region above
    40 is at least as good. 40 sits on a stable, still-improving plateau, not a bump.
1. **The 2× crossover is noisy, and the first *robust* margin is 40, not 25.** 25 epochs passes all four seeds but with
    min 2.05 — inside the seed spread — and its neighbour 30 epochs *fails* a seed at 1.89. So 25–30 straddle the 2×
    line within the run-to-run noise; a single casual run there cannot be trusted. 40 is the cheapest horizon whose
    **worst-of-four-seeds (2.47) clears 2× comfortably**, and 50/60/80 stay comfortable. The hoped-for 4–8× cheaper
    reference (5–10 epochs) is dead: those are 0.9–1.4×.
1. **Mechanism, resolved on the horizon axis.** The healthy re-expansion **saturates by ~40 epochs** (5.53, then flat
    5.6–5.8 through 80). Above 40 the ratio still creeps up almost entirely because the **PC keeps slowly sinking**
    (1.94 → 1.77 at 80, *below* the nominal ~1.9 BN floor). "Healthy" is a horizon-saturating quantity; "collapsed" is
    a slowly-deepening one; and the dip bottom itself drifts *later* with horizon (epoch ~3 at 5ep → ~8–9 at 20ep)
    because the recovery is anneal-phased. **SimSiam at this toy scale needs ~40 epochs for the healthy signal to
    saturate, and the contrast becomes trustworthy only once it does.**

**Verdict: keep 40 epochs as the calibration reference** — it is already the minimum robust-≥2× horizon (now on 4 seeds,
min 2.47×) and is confirmed to be a plateau, not a lucky point. The horizon sweep's payoff is mechanistic (how much
horizon SimSiam needs to become healthy here), not a cheaper reference.

## Conclusion: no immediate win — carry the 40-epoch IID reference

There is **no single-pass corner we can certify as a calibration baseline**, and the reason is structural (the
single-pass and LR mechanisms above), not a threshold or hyperparameter that needs nudging. Re-tuning the gate cannot
manufacture a 2× separation the dynamics do not produce at this horizon. So the **IID × 40-epoch corner remains the
calibration reference we must carry**; Phase-1 single-pass RankMe is read against *that* fixed upper reference, not
against a single-pass "healthy" arm (a mid-transient, non-asymptotic value that would move under us).

The silver lining is real but narrower than the hoped-for win: the single-pass healthy representation is **not** broken
— it holds above 4.0, well clear of the eventual collapse floor — and it is **ordering-insensitive** at this horizon. A
single-pass intact backbone is thus a sane Phase-1 starting point, but not a substitute for the calibration corner,
which needs the long horizon to make collapse legible.

## Insights

1. **The instrument was never broken — the baseline was.** P0.2's ambiguous RankMe decay on the intact arm was a
    training-budget artifact, not a property of SimSiam or of RankMe. Given a fair regime, RankMe cleanly separates a
    healthy representation from a collapsed one at this toy scale — which is exactly what licenses reading Phase-1
    RankMe drops as degradation.
1. **The discriminator is regime-dependent.** Loss separates the arms at a short toy horizon; RankMe separates them once
    trained properly. A calibration gate must be tied to the regime it will be read in — which is why P0.2.1 both
    *finds the baseline* and *re-derives the gate* in that regime, rather than porting P0.2's loss-based thresholds.
1. **The healthy signature is a U-shape, not monotonicity.** The early RankMe dip is healthy reorganization, not
    incipient collapse; the tell is whether it re-expands. Phase 1 readouts should expect this shape from intact
    backbones and not misread the dip.
1. **Predictor width is part of "healthy SimSiam."** The anti-collapse predictor must be wide enough to do its job; an
    over-narrow bottleneck weakens the very mechanism under study.
1. **The calibration is a long-horizon, IID phenomenon — no target-regime shortcut.** The 2×2 matrix fails for two
    distinct reasons: correlated ordering suppresses the healthy arm (contrast closes from above), a single pass leaves
    the collapse control under-developed (from below). Only IID × 40 epochs separates cleanly, so Phase 1 reads against
    that fixed reference — the baseline does **not** transfer to the single-pass or correlated corners.
1. **Correlation is a multi-epoch effect at this scale.** IID and class-blocked are nearly indistinguishable at
    single-pass; the ~40% suppression from correlated ordering emerges only under repeated exposure — so Phase-1
    degradation from *ordering alone* may be milder than the 40-epoch ablation suggests.
1. **LR is not the missing lever.** At single-pass horizon a high LR is *itself* a collapse cause, coupled to the
    ablation through one knob, so no LR (annealed or flat, either seed) floors the PC while holding the healthy arm up.
    The contrast's failure is the short horizon, not a bad hyperparameter.

## How to run

```bash
# CPU (canonical calibration corner: IID x 40 epochs, deterministic init; ~3 min/arm):
uv run python scripts/positive_control.py            # seed=0; add seed=1 for the robustness check

# The other three corners of the 2x2 matrix (all expected to FAIL — see the matrix section):

# (eval_every_epochs<1 gives a legible per-few-step trajectory over the short single-pass horizon.)

# LR sweep on the single-pass IID cell (is there an LR where PC floors AND healthy holds? there is not).

```

Each run writes both arms' `run_log.jsonl` and a `comparison.json` (per-checkpoint series + the gate result) to the
Hydra run dir, and prints the side-by-side table, the RankMe/loss sparklines, and the `PASS`/`FAIL` verdict. Regime and
gate thresholds live in `cafl4ds/configs/positive_control.yaml`; the multi-epoch + LR-schedule machinery is in
`cafl4ds/loop.py` and `cafl4ds/schedule.py` (unit-tested in `tests/unit/test_loop.py` and
`tests/unit/test_schedule.py`).
