"""Phase-0 positive control (P0.5) — the MAE shortcut / stable-loss degradation gate.

Runs, in **one session**, two arms of the SAME from-scratch MAE over the SAME **IID** stream,
differing only by ONE shortcut lever:

* **shortcut** — the lever relaxed so the encoder can take a low-level shortcut (a **low mask
  ratio**, P0.5.0; or an **over-powered decoder**, P0.5.1). Its reconstruction loss stays
  low/healthy-looking while its frozen-probe accuracy **craters** — the "loss lies" case.
* **healthy** — MAE at the standard operating point (mask 0.75, lightweight decoder), which
  reaches a **good** frozen-probe accuracy (real headroom above chance).

The lever is the *only* difference: the seed is reset before building each arm so the two
encoders start bit-identical and their augmentation RNG stays in lockstep, so any divergence is
attributable to the lever alone. The init factor (``init=``) selects the vehicle: **from-scratch**
(P0.5.0/P0.5.1 — the clean producer of a full-rank-but-useless rep) or **pretrained-continue** from
a competent, capacity-gated well (P0.5.2 — degrade-*from-competent*, where a smaller competent model
has less slack so the shortcut bites; pretrain the well first with ``scripts/pretrain.py`` at the
same encoder capacity).

**What the gate is, and is not.** The failure mode is a representation that is **full-rank but
useless**, so RankMe staying high is the mode's **precondition**, not a fire (a RankMe crater would
mean P0.2 collapse, not this mode). The gate certifies the mode was *induced* (precondition +
probe crater + the loss does not alarm + contrast). It deliberately does **not** gate on the
label-free reader: the study's real deliverable is the **reader verdict** — does `alignment` /
`uniformity` track the probe's crater on an MAE backbone, or does the P0.2 suite have a quality
blind spot? — and a fire *or* a clean null is a legitimate result, so the verdict is **reported**
either way. On the P0.5.2 degrade-from-competent vehicle the panel also carries the MAE-native
candidates (`clusterability`, `attn_distance`, `alignment_strong`); a fire closes the mode's
portfolio gap, a clean null against a genuine crater is a strong earned negative. See
``docs/experiments/phase0/P0.5.0.md``, ``P0.5.1.md`` and ``P0.5.2.md``.
