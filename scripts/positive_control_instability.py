"""Phase-0 positive control (P0.4.0) — the INSTABILITY / DIVERGENCE-instrument gate.

The collapse gate (``positive_control.py``, P0.2.x) and the forgetting gate
(``positive_control_forgetting.py``, P0.3.x) say nothing about whether the *instability*
detector — the **gradient norm** — works. This harness is their divergence analogue: it
drives a deliberately pathological learning rate until the loss runs to non-finite and checks
that the grad norm **fires** (blows up, ideally *ahead* of the loss NaN), while a matched
sane-LR baseline stays **quiet** (bounded, ~stationary) *and* genuinely learns — the same
two-sided discipline, a third failure mode.

Vehicle (P0.4.0): the **same MAE** over the **same IID STL-10 stream** from a seed-reset,
bit-identical start, with **warmup OFF and grad-clip OFF** on every arm so the learning rate is
the sole difference and clipping (the standard mitigation) cannot mask the blow-up. MAE is the
vehicle because divergence needs an **unbounded** loss — its per-patch MSE can genuinely blow up
to inf/NaN, whereas SimSiam's bounded negative-cosine loss *collapses* instead. Divergence is an
**optimization** phenomenon (a numerical positive-feedback runaway), so it reproduces faithfully
at toy scale — unlike forgetting, this study is seconds-to-minutes on CPU.

The harness runs one **healthy** arm at ``lr_healthy`` (the invariant quiet reference) and one
**PC** arm per LR in ``lr_sweep`` (the dose-response). The instrument is read from the per-step
``{step, loss, grad_norm, finite}`` trace the instrumented :class:`~cafl4ds.loop.StreamingLoop`
now logs. The gate (see :func:`_evaluate_instability_gate`) is the contrast between the healthy
and the highest-LR PC traces, plus the **lead time** between the grad-norm spike and the loss
going non-finite — the leading-indicator payoff that would license grad norm as a live signal.

Examples:
    Default (STL-10, CPU — the whole dose-response in one session)::

        uv run python scripts/positive_control_instability.py

    A finer / higher sweep, or a single operating point::

        uv run python scripts/positive_control_instability.py 'lr_sweep=[1e-3,2e-3,4e-3,8e-3]'
        uv run python scripts/positive_control_instability.py 'lr_sweep=[3e-3]'

    Batch-size ablation (raises gradient *variance*, a route to divergence other than LR magnitude)::

        uv run python scripts/positive_control_instability.py batch_size=16
