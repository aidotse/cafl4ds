"""Phase-0 positive control (P0.4.1) — the DATA-driven SURPRISE / SHOCK instability read.

The deployment-relevant companion to :mod:`scripts.positive_control_instability` (P0.4.0). Where
P0.4.0 forces divergence with a pathological learning rate — the clean, controllable lever —
P0.4.1 asks the question that matters for cafl4ds's stream regime: does the **gradient-norm**
instrument fire on **data surprise** (an out-of-distribution burst arriving mid-stream), and can it
tell a *transient, recoverable* shock from a *runaway* one?

Vehicle: the **same instrumented** :class:`~cafl4ds.loop.StreamingLoop` and the **same MAE + SGD**
as P0.4.0 — but with **raw (un-normalized) reconstruction MSE** (``norm_pix_loss=false``), because
surprise must register in the loss *magnitude* and ``norm_pix`` caps the per-patch loss near 1.0 for
any content (a P0.4.1 vehicle finding). Over a hand-built stream: ``warm_steps`` of a **base**
distribution (STL-10) so the MAE is genuinely competent, then a ``burst_steps`` shock, then
``tail_steps`` of the base again so a transient spike's *recovery* is observable. Two arms from a
seed-reset, bit-identical start differing ONLY by whether the burst is injected:

* **shock** — base -> burst -> base: the grad norm **spikes** at the burst (a change point), then
  either **recovers** to the pre-burst band (transient) or **runs away** (divergence).
* **control** — the base throughout (no burst): the grad norm stays **in band** (quiet reference).

The gate (see :func:`_evaluate_surprise_gate`) is the **two-sided (shock vs. control at the same
steps) change-point contrast** — the shock's ``burst peak / control same-step peak`` grad norm
firing while the control's within-arm band stays flat — plus a base-competence precondition (the
warm loss must descend) and that the burst is genuinely surprising (a higher raw loss than the
control's same steps).

Key finding: the grad norm reads reconstruction-error **magnitude**, i.e. a **content** shock, NOT
distributional novelty. The positive control that fires is a ``noise`` burst scaled **out of the
trained ``[0, 1]`` range** (``burst_scale`` > 1, a saturating sensor-corruption shock). An in-range
distributional-OOD burst (``burst_kind=dataset``: CIFAR / grayscale / phase-scrambled) does **not**
fire — its raw reconstruction error is comparable to the base, below the grad-norm variance floor —
so grad norm is not a distribution-shift detector for MAE. The ``burst_scale`` amplitude is a clean
data-shock **severity dose-response** at fixed ``lr_op``: below threshold the spike recovers
(transient — severity ≠ permanence), above it the shock *triggers* a divergence (the burst completes
its runaway in the base tail), with the lead time **shrinking** as severity grows — the data-driven
analogue of P0.4.0's lead-time / operating-envelope finding. The ``lr_sweep`` ladder is the negative
control: LR-driven divergence fires during *warm* (shock ≡ control NaN step), so it is
shock-independent.

Examples:
    Default (STL-10 base, saturating-noise shock, CPU — the whole read in one session)::

        uv run python scripts/positive_control_data_surprise.py

    The data-shock severity dose-response (no-fire -> transient -> runaway)::

        uv run python scripts/positive_control_data_surprise.py 'burst_scale=1'  # in-range: no fire
        uv run python scripts/positive_control_data_surprise.py 'burst_scale=8'  # over threshold: runaway

    The distributional-OOD non-fire ladder (the refuted naive vehicle)::

        uv run python scripts/positive_control_data_surprise.py burst_kind=dataset data_b=cifar100_scrambled
