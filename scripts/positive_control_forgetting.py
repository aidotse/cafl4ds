"""Phase-0 positive control (P0.3) — the FORGETTING-instrument calibration gate.

The collapse gate (``positive_control.py``, P0.2.x) says nothing about whether the *forgetting*
detectors work. This harness is its forgetting analogue: it induces a deliberate catastrophic-
forgetting event and checks that the forgetting instruments **fire** on it, while a matched
no-forgetting control stays **quiet** — the same two-sided discipline, a different failure mode.

Vehicle (P0.3.0): a **split-task** stream over MAE. STL-10's classes are partitioned into two
disjoint tasks, ``task_a_classes`` (era A) and ``task_b_classes`` (era B). Each arm trains in two
phases over the SAME data, differing only by a single **replay** toggle:

* **PC (forgets)** — phase A trains on task A only, then phase B trains on task B **only**. With
  no revisits to A, the representation respecializes to B and task-A probe accuracy craters.
* **healthy (holds)** — identical phase A, then phase B **replays A** (trains on A ∪ B). Task A
  is revisited, so its probe accuracy holds. The replay toggle is the *only* difference — the
  seed is reset before each arm so phase A is bit-identical, isolating forgetting as the cause.

The forgetting instruments are read from the two-phase accuracy matrix ``R[i][j]`` = accuracy on
task ``j`` after phase ``i`` (phase 0 = after A, phase 1 = after B), plus the label-free backbone
drift:

* **Backward Transfer** ``BWT = R[1][0] - R[0][0]`` (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato 2017) — negative ⇒ later
  learning eroded task A.
* **Forgetting Measure** ``FM = R[0][0] - R[1][0]`` (Chaudhry et al. 2018) — the drop from task
  A's best (post-A) to its final accuracy.
* **CKA / cosine drift** — how far the backbone moved *during phase B*, referenced to the post-A
  representation (the label-free leading indicator).

Both instruments (:func:`~cafl4ds.eval.backward_transfer`, :func:`~cafl4ds.eval.forgetting_measure`,
the :class:`~cafl4ds.monitor.HealthMonitor` drift) already exist from P0.1 — P0.3 *calibrates*
them, it does not build them.

Examples:
    Default (STL-10, CPU — small, for a plumbing check)::

        uv run python scripts/positive_control_forgetting.py

    Escalated MAE on the Gaudi HPU (the P0.3.0 fair regime; see docs/developing.md)::

        ./scripts/run_gaudi_dev.sh -m /mnt/stl10 gaudi-env-cafl4ds:latest 0 \
